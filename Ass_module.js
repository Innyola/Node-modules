Node.js Modules

A module is a piece of reusable JavaScript code. It could be a .js file or a directory containing .js files. 

They are the blocks of encapsulated code that communicate with an external application on the basis of their 
related functionality.Modules help developers adhere to the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle in 
programming. They also help to break down complex logic into small, simple, and manageable chunks.

Modules are of three types:

Core Modules
local Modules
Third-party Modules

Core Modules:

Node.js core modules are a set of built-in modules which can be used without any further installation. 
They come with Node.js installation and are loaded into the program by using the required function.
